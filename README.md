Each question on this exam must be completed on a designated Fabric node, most of which run Fabric under docker/docker-compose. 

Most of the networks are based off of byfn with configuration files located under /srv/fabric-samples, unless otherwise noted in the question text.

Candidates may use their Chrome or Chromium browser to open one additional tab in order to access assets at https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/
